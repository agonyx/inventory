# Niche Inventory — Production Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-04-24
> Project: ~/projects/niche-inventory
> Stack: Hono + TypeORM + PostgreSQL (server), React + Vite + TailwindCSS (web), Docker + nginx
> Current state: Phase 7 in progress — structured logging, API docs, lazy routes, dark mode, seed script, README, CI/CD, DB indexes

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Security (Est: 1–2 weeks)

> Goal: Make it safe to deploy and use with real data. No new features — just harden what exists.

### 1.1 Authentication System
- [ ] Replace static Bearer token with JWT (access + refresh tokens)
- [ ] Add `User` entity: id, email, passwordHash, name, role (admin/manager/warehouse), createdAt, lastLogin
- [ ] Add `POST /api/auth/login` — email + password → JWT pair
- [ ] Add `POST /api/auth/refresh` — refresh token → new access token
- [ ] Add `POST /api/auth/logout` — invalidate refresh token
- [ ] Add `GET /api/auth/me` — return current user
- [ ] Auth middleware reads JWT from `Authorization: Bearer` header (keep Bearer format)
- [ ] Add bcrypt for password hashing (`bcryptjs` — pure JS, no native deps)
- [ ] Seed script: create default admin user on first run
- [ ] Frontend: Login page, auth state in React Query, token refresh interceptor in `apiFetch`
- [ ] Remove `DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN` hardcoded fallback from `client.ts`

### 1.2 Webhook Security
- [ ] Add webhook secret config (`WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var)
- [ ] Require `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex>` header on `POST /webhooks/orders`
- [ ] Verify HMAC-SHA256 of request body against secret
- [ ] Return 401 on signature mismatch
- [ ] Add per-source secrets support (shopify_secret, etsy_secret, etc.)

### 1.3 Transaction Safety
- [ ] Wrap `PATCH /api/orders/:id/status` handler in `AppDataSource.transaction()`
- [ ] Move inventory level reads inside the transaction (currently outside — stale reads possible)
- [ ] Add optimistic locking on inventory levels (version column or `WHERE quantity = expected`)

### 1.4 Database Migrations
- [ ] Run `typeorm migration:generate` to capture current schema as baseline migration
- [ ] Set `synchronize: false` in production, `synchronize: true` only in dev
- [ ] Add `npm run db:migrate` and `npm run db:migrate:revert` scripts
- [ ] Run migrations as part of Docker server entrypoint (before app start)
- [ ] Add migration CI step (generate + check for uncommitted changes)

### 1.5 Error Handling Standardization
- [ ] Create `AppError` class with `statusCode`, `code`, `message`, `details?`
- [ ] Create error codes enum: `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `CONFLICT`, `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`
- [ ] Global error handler maps `AppError` to structured JSON response: `{ error: { code, message, details } }`
- [ ] Replace all `c.json({ error: string }, status)` with `throw new AppError(...)`
- [ ] Remove fragile string-matching error classification in both `index.ts` and `webhooks.ts`

### 1.6 Infrastructure Hardening
- [ ] Move all secrets to `.env` file, use `env_file` in docker-compose
- [ ] Add `.env.example` with all required vars documented
- [ ] Add `restart: unless-stopped` to all services
- [ ] Add memory limits: `deploy.resources.limits.memory` (server: 512MB, db: 1GB, web: 128MB)
- [ ] Add nginx security headers:
  ```
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosnose
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  ```
- [ ] Enable gzip in nginx (`gzip on; gzip_types text/plain application/json text/css application/javascript`)
- [ ] Add `client_max_body_size 10m;` to nginx
- [ ] Add caching headers for static assets (`/assets/` — 1 year, `index.html` — no-cache)
- [ ] Make CORS origin configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var

### 1.7 Audit Log Viewer
- [ ] Add `GET /api/audit-logs` — with pagination, filters (entityType, entityId, action, dateRange, performedBy)
- [ ] Add `GET /api/audit-logs/:id`
- [ ] Frontend: Audit log page (`/audit-logs`) with table, filters, pagination
- [ ] Add nav link to audit logs

---

## Phase 2 — Core UX & Data (Est: 2–3 weeks)

> Goal: Make day-to-day warehouse operations smooth. Focus on the pages staff use constantly.

### 2.1 Pagination (Backend + Frontend)
- [ ] Create reusable pagination helper: `parsePagination(query)` → `{ skip, take, page, limit }`
- [ ] Standardized response format for list endpoints:
  ```json
  { "data": [...], "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 25, "total": 142, "totalPages": 6 } }
  ```
- [ ] Add pagination to: `GET /api/products`, `GET /api/orders`, `GET /api/locations`, `GET /api/inventory`, `GET /api/audit-logs`
- [ ] Default page size: 25, max: 100
- [ ] Frontend: pagination component (prev/next + page numbers), integrate into all list views
- [ ] React Query: store `page` and `limit` in query state, invalidate on mutations

### 2.2 Search & Filtering
- [ ] Products: search by name/SKU (`ILIKE`), filter by category, filter by stock status (in_stock/low_stock/out_of_stock)
- [ ] Orders: search by externalOrderId/customerName/customerEmail, filter by status, filter by source, filter by date range
- [ ] Inventory: filter by location, filter by product, filter by low stock
- [ ] Audit logs: filter by entityType, action, date range, performedBy
- [ ] Backend: add `?search=...`, `?category=...`, `?status=...`, `?from=...&to=...` query params
- [ ] Frontend: filter bar component with debounced search input (300ms), dropdown selects, date pickers
- [ ] Persist filter state in URL search params (useSearchParams) so filters survive navigation

### 2.3 Column Sorting
- [ ] Backend: add `?sortBy=createdAt&sortDir=desc` query params to list endpoints
- [ ] Validate `sortBy` against allowed columns whitelist (prevent SQL injection on ORDER BY)
- [ ] Frontend: clickable column headers with sort direction indicator (↑↓)
- [ ] Persist sort state in URL search params

### 2.4 Locations Management Page
- [ ] Frontend: `/locations` page with CRUD table (create, edit, delete)
- [ ] Use existing `useLocations` and `useCreateLocation` hooks
- [ ] Add `useUpdateLocation` and `useDeleteLocation` hooks
- [ ] Add `GET /api/locations/:id` endpoint
- [ ] Add nav link to locations
- [ ] Show variant count per location in table

### 2.5 Variant Management
- [ ] Allow adding/removing variants on product edit (currently stripped)
- [ ] Add `POST /api/products/:id/variants` — add variant to existing product
- [ ] Add `PATCH /api/products/:productId/variants/:variantId` — edit variant
- [ ] Add `DELETE /api/products/:productId/variants/:variantId` — remove variant (cascade delete inventory levels)
- [ ] Frontend: variant editor within ProductForm — add/remove rows dynamically
- [ ] Warning when deleting variant with non-zero inventory

### 2.6 UI Polish
- [ ] Add loading skeleton components for table rows and cards
- [ ] Add React error boundary wrapper around routes (show "Something went wrong" + retry button)
- [ ] Add 404 page for unknown routes
- [ ] Add toast notification system (sonner or react-hot-toast): success (green), error (red), info (blue)
- [ ] Replace `window.confirm` delete dialogs with proper confirmation modal
- [ ] Add per-field form validation: red borders, error messages below inputs
- [ ] Add success toast after create/update/delete operations
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation: Tab through table rows, Enter to expand, Escape to close modals

### 2.7 Export
- [ ] Add `GET /api/products/export?format=csv&filters...` — server-side CSV generation
- [ ] Add `GET /api/orders/export?format=csv&filters...`
- [ ] Add `GET /api/inventory/export?format=csv&filters...`
- [ ] Use current filters/search/sort when exporting
- [ ] Frontend: "Export CSV" button on each list page
- [ ] Consider adding xlsx format via `exceljs`

- [ ] Frontend: Stocktake page with count entry form, discrepancy highlights, completion confirmation

### 3.4 Barcode Support
- [ ] Add `barcode` field to `ProductVariant` entity (store EAN-13, UPC, or custom barcode)
- [ ] Search products/variants by barcode (via search API)
- [ ] Frontend: barcode input field on pick list page (type barcode → find item → mark as picked)
- [ ] Consider `html5-qrcode` for camera-based scanning on mobile
- [ ] Barcode display on pick list PDF

### 3.5 Bulk Operations
- [ ] Products: bulk delete (select via checkboxes)
- [ ] Orders: bulk status change (select multiple → confirm/pack/ship)
- [ ] Inventory: bulk adjust (select multiple levels → set quantity)
- [ ] Frontend: checkbox column, "select all" toggle, floating action bar with bulk action buttons
- [ ] Backend: `POST /api/products/bulk-delete`, `POST /api/orders/bulk-status`, `POST /api/inventory/bulk-adjust`

---

## Phase 7 — Polish & Scale (Est: 2–3 weeks)

> Goal: Make it professional-grade — performance, reliability, developer experience.

### 7.1 CI/CD
- [x] GitHub Actions: type check → test → build on PR
- [x] GitHub Actions: build + push Docker images on merge to main (GHCR)
- [-] GitHub Actions: deploy to staging on merge to main, deploy to prod on tag — _deferred: no staging environment yet_
- [-] Add ESLint + Prettier config, enforce in CI — _deferred: low ROI for solo/small-team project_
- [x] Add `tsc --noEmit` to CI for type checking

### 7.2 Monitoring & Logging
- [x] Structured JSON logging on server (pino)
- [x] Request logging middleware: method, path, status, duration, userId
- [-] Docker: centralized logging driver or Loki integration — _deferred: overkill for single-host deployment_
- [-] Optional: Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) — _deferred: not needed until multi-service_
- [-] Optional: Sentry for frontend error tracking — _deferred: add when user base grows_

### 7.3 Performance
- [-] Add Redis for caching frequently accessed data — _deferred: not needed at current scale_
- [x] Add database connection pooling config (already via TypeORM, but tune pool size) — _handled by TypeORM defaults, tune if needed under load_
- [x] Add `SELECT` column projection (don't always fetch all columns, especially for list views)
- [x] Add database indexes on frequently queried columns (status, createdAt, SKU)
- [x] Frontend: lazy load routes with `React.lazy` + `Suspense`
- [-] Frontend: virtual scrolling for large tables — _deferred: add when tables exceed ~500 rows_

### 7.4 Database Backups
- [x] Add `pg_dump` script (daily, keep 30 days) — `scripts/backup.sh`
- [-] Optional: WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery — _deferred: daily pg_dump sufficient for now_
- [-] Backup verification: restore to test DB weekly — _deferred: manual verification adequate_
- [x] Document backup/restore procedure in README

### 7.5 API Documentation
- [x] Add `@hono/swagger-ui` for interactive API docs
- [-] Add JSDoc/OpenAPI annotations to route handlers — _deferred: spec is manually curated, annotations add marginal value_
- [x] Generate OpenAPI spec (manually curated, 50+ endpoints)
- [x] Accessible at `/docs` route

### 7.6 Developer Experience
- [x] Add seed script (`bun run db:seed`) that creates demo data (products, locations, orders, inventory)
- [x] Add `.env.example` with all variables documented
- [x] Update README with: setup instructions, architecture overview, API overview, deployment guide
- [-] Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with code style, commit conventions, PR process — _deferred: add when accepting external contributors_
- [-] Consider monorepo tooling (turborepo or nx) for shared types — _deferred: shared types not yet a pain point_

### 7.7 Frontend Extras
- [x] Dark mode toggle (TailwindCSS dark: prefix, localStorage preference)
- [-] PWA manifest + service worker for offline-capable pick list — _deferred: niche use case, add if warehouse goes offline_
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts: `/` to focus search, `n` for new, `Esc` to close
- [-] Internationalization foundation (i18next) — _deferred: English-only for now, restructure if multi-language needed_
